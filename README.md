# DS4002-Sentiment-Analysis

This project is a sentiment analysis using SPAM/HAM Text Classification data. It looks at whether there is a distinct separation between SPAM and HAM text messages and aims to predict whether a given text will be SPAM or HAM using the Support Vector Machine Algorithm. It utilizes different variations of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE-SVM, SMOTE-KNN). This project was completed in 4 days during January Term for the UVA DS 4002 course.
